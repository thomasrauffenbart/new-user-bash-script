# new-user-bash-script
A bash script to create a new user with a home directory and password

On a mission to learn BASH, I wrote this script. It is a program that creates a new user with a home directory and a password instead of running useradd -m and passwd commands.

This script has to be run with the sudo command by a user with admin privileges and I will continue to build it out as I learn more and more BASH. I am currently working on adding a help menu and more text instruction throughout the script. 

Hopefully, I can develop this script to the point where it is a useful tool for Linux administrators to easily create new users with home directories and passwords.

I have found Joe Collins of Ezee Linux to be a fantastic teacher of this subject https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCm0GuiBDKo 
He has a dedicated website beyond his youtube channel and brings a personable and welcoming element to his teachings. I highly recommend taking a look at his resources if you are looking to learn BASH and the Linux command line.
