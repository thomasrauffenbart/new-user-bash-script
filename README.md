# new-user-bash-script
A bash script to create a new user with a home directory and password

On a mission to learn BASH and through a learning plan for DevOps/Cloud work, I wrote this BASH script, it is a basic program that creates a new user with a home directory and a password instead of running useradd -m and passwd commands.

This script has to be run with the sudo command by a user with admin privileges and I will continue to build it out as I learn more and more BASH. I am currently working on adding a help menu and more text instruction throughout the script. 

Hopefully, I can develop this script to the point where it is actually useful for a Linux administrator to easily create new users with home directories and passwords.
